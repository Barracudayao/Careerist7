Below The Arithmetical Mean
When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original listâ€™s arithmetical mean.
The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]

'''
Two Lowest Elements
When given a list of elements, find the two lowest elements.
They can be equal to each other or different.
Example: [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2], Return: 2, 3

'''
Even First
Your input is an array of integers, and you have to reorder its entries so that the even entries appear first. You are required to solve it without allocating additional storage (operate with the input array).
Example: [7, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2] Return [6, 4, 10, 2, 7, 3, 5, 3]

'''
Increment a Number
Write a program that takes as input an array of digits encoding a nonnegative decimal integer D and updates the array to represent the integer D + 1.
For example, if the input is [1, 2, 9] then you should update the array to [1, 3, 0].
